# AwesomeOpossums
Capstone project for the CodeKY program Web Development Pt.1 class.

## Description
```
A site for submitting pictures of awesome opossums you've spotted, as well as links to informational articles and other relevant and useful opossum-related websites. 

Please note that the layout breaks when viewed in Internet Explorer, and the social media buttons in the footer are only images (not actual links) used for illustrative purposes. 

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. .background
Adds a transparent background to various sections of the site to make the content more easily readable against the background.

2. .invis
Used to add display:none to elements. Specifcially used by the JavaScript function to show/hide the hamburger icon based on screen sizes specified in media querys.

3. .top-nav 
Adds padding and a background color to the nav menu, and is also used to tweak the layout and appearance of the nav based on the screen size the site is viewed in.
```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. formgrab()
Grabs the first name that was entered into the submission form, and when the form is submitted it displays a thank you message in an alert using the given information. (ex: "Thank you Jane, your submission has been receieved!")
